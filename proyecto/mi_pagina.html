                        <p><i>Are you making the most of education technology?</i><br> Faculty like you face a daunting
                            workload as you juggle teaching, grading, researching, writing, and any number of
                            administrative duties. Similarly, when utilizing education
                            technology in the higher education classroom, it can be difficult to strike a balance that
                            helps your students to learn more deeply and effectively rather than further dissociating
                            them from the material. We surveyed hundreds
                            of faculty members in order to better understand how instructors like yourself are dealing
                            with the rise in popularity of technology in higher education. Based on our findings, we’ve
                            put together five tips to help you make
                            classroom technology work to your advantage. This white paper includes: In depth analysis
                            and visualization of the responses received from higher education faculty relating to the
                            use of technology in higher education. Anecdotal
                            evidence and commentary provided by higher education professionals interviewed after taking
                            the survey. Ideas for making the most of the technology available to you. Questions
                            designed to generate further thought and discussion

<h2 style="color:crimson;">Some features you may Know</h2>
<p>

    <h2>Advantages of technology</h2>
    First, the evolution of technology is beneficial to humans for several reasons. At the medical level, technology
    can
    help treat more sick people and consequently save many lives and combat very harmful viruses and bacteria.

    The invention of the computer was a very important point. Communication is thus enhanced, and companies can
    communicate
    more easily with foreign countries. Research is also simplified.

    For companies, progress in implementing strategic technology trends is helping them save time and therefore, money.
    Exchanges are faster especially with the internet. Sales and purchases are now facilitated and possible worldwide.
    This
    allows businesses to buy raw materials with discounts or at reduced prices. Similarly, global tourism has grown.

    Technology has also increased the productivity of almost every industry in the world. Thanks to technology, we can
    even
    pay with bitcoins instead of using banks. The digital coin has been such a game changing factor, that many realised
    that this is the right time to open a bitcoin demo account.

    When observed more closely, new things are discovered every day. Let’s take for instance when radio waves were
    discovered, radio broadcasts followed suit almost immediately. The same applies to the television and electricity.
    If
    no one had discovered that electricity could be generated, then the entertainment industry wouldn’t be at it’s
    current
    stage of development.

    Technology improves daily lives; allowing to move physical storage units to virtual storage banks and more.
    Scientists
    of the time are also able to send astronauts to the moon thanks to technology.

    <h3>Disadvantages and risks of technology</h3>

    On the other hand, the evolution of modern technology has disadvantages, for example, dependence on new technology.
    Man
    no longer needs to think. Even if the calculator is a good invention, man no longer makes mental calculation and no
    longer works his memory. The decline of human capital implies an increase in unemployment. In some areas, devices
    can
    replace the human mind.

    The use of technology certainly needs rule and new laws. For example internet use is an individual freedom.
    However,
    the invention of the atomic bomb cannot be an individual freedom. In fact, regulations are difficult to implement
    when
    these technologies are introduced – such as regulation surrounding the impending arrival of autonomous vehicles.

    Finally, as most technological discoveries aim to reduce human effort, it would imply that more work is done by
    machines. This equates to less work for people: the human is becoming ever so obsolete by the day, as processes
    become
    automated and jobs are made redundant.

    The negative impact of the influence of technology on children should not be underestimated as well.
